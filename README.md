# toggl-visualizer
A simple app that lets you generate toggl graphs from csv files


# Working
I'm not too keen on providing documentation, and this is not a project that aims to provide new features, just one that hopes to cut down time for those who wish to visualize toggl graphs

If you want to check out how exactly it works, from the main directory, run 

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 sample.py
```

and you should get a plotly graph

# The Future

I'll make a directory mapping and auto-graphing module for this in the future.
