# toggl-visualizer
A simple app that lets you generate toggl graphs from csv files



# Working
Documentation is yet to be written. But given a toggl exported csv file, it can plot a plotly pie graph. This feature was recently put behind a paywall by plotly.

If you want to check out how exactly it works, from the main directory, run 

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 sample.py
```

and you should get a plotly graph


## Using your own data
To use your own data, just modify the sample.py file to contain your filepath and your cleaned filepath instead of the sample


# The Future

A directory mapping and auto-graphing module is planned
